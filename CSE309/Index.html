            CS106Sis a survey course on the application of fundamental computer
            science concepts from CS 106B to problems in the social good space
            (such as health, government, education, and environment). Each week
            consists of in-class activities designed by student groups, local
            tech companies, and nonprofits. Some of the topics we will cover
            include mental health chatbots, tumor classification with basic
            machine learning, sentiment analysis of tweets on refugees, and the
            ethical obligation of good security. Recommended
            prerequisite/corequisite:CS106S.

                While CS106S does not have a waitlist, we encourage all
                interested students to attend the first class; historically, we
                have not had to turn students away from CS106S for enrollment
                reasons.

            know you are being equipped with the tools to make super cool stuff.
            However, sometimes it is difficult to see where these tools fit in
            the larger scheme of things. We want to show you ways to put the
            skills you have learned to good social use!Here are our objectives:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span>Awareness:</span>For students to gain awarness about the
              applicability of technology and computer science to enact social
              good in the world.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Exposure:</span>For students to learn how to utilize their
              skills to build tools and projects that create positive social

            <li>
              <span>Utilization:</span>For students to gain exposure to the
              variety of current projects and efforts to use computer science
              for social good.

          </ul>
          <p>
            Now, let's get into some important details: expectations, grading,
            and meeting time!
          </p>
          <h1>Student Expectations</h4>
          <p>
            Students are expected to attend class each week and participate in
            class lectures, discussions, and exercises. Every week will have a
            check-off form with some simple questions from class and feedback
            prompts for the teaching team; we leave time at the end of class for
            you to complete the check-off form (and we expect it to take no more
            than five minutes), and will close at 11:59pm the day of class. This
            will be the way we check your attendance.
          </p>
          <h1>Grading</h4>
          <p>
            Students will be graded on the basis of attendance and
            participation. Participation and attending a minimum of 8 out of 9
            classes are requirements to receive credit. In the case that a
            student will miss more than one class due to extenuating
            circumstances, please contact the teaching staff to receive an
            excused absence (e.g., illness). If you miss class, please email us!
            We understand that life can be complicated, and can provide excused
            absences when necessary. We will always create a path for you to
            pass CS 106S &mdash; but we promise that the easiest way will be
            just to come to class.
          </p>
          <h1>Meeting Time &amp; Coursework</h4>
          <p>
            CS106S will meet every Tuesday afternoon from 4:30p to 6:30p PT in
            540-108. Students will receive 1 unit of S/NC credit. Except in
            cases where students miss class (which we will handle on a case by
            case basis), no work will be required outside of our class meetings.
          </p>
          <h1>Auditing</h4>
          <p>
            We welcome auditors! Send an email to
            <strong>cs106s-aut2223-staff@lists.stanford.edu</strong> to be added
            to the mailing list. Because CS 106S is offered in-person (and
            lectures are not recorded), only on-campus Stanford students can
            attend. That being said, anyone may use our digital materials. (And
            feel free to email us if you think we forgot to post something!)
          </p>
          <h1>Stanford Policies</h4>
          <p>
            All students are expected to abide by Stanfordâ€™s Honor Code and to
            wear a mask if attending in-person.
          </p>
          <h1>Students with Documented Disabilities</h4>
          <p>
            Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact
            of a disability must initiate the request with the
            (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate the request with required
            documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an
            Accommodation Letter for faculty dated in the current quarter in
            which the request is being made. Students should contact the OAE as
            soon as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate
            accommodations. The OAE is located at 563 Salvatierra Walk (phone:
            650-723-1066)
